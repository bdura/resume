% InVivo AI is a Montréal-based start up aiming to bring the power of machine learning to drug discovery. My work there focused on fundamental research, designing algorithms able to cope with the dire data scarcity that plagues computational drug discovery. I consequently wrote a report detailing my work.
% The main project I worked on, Adaptive Deep Kernel Learning, aims to teach a network to extract knowledge from multiple related tasks at once, a paradigm called meta-learning. Our innovation came from adding a separate network that constructs a description of the task, which is used to adapt the algorithm at deployment time.
% We also worked on trying to better understand how meta-learning behaves depending on the task distribution. We used toy datasets as well as computed molecular descriptors, giving us control on the level of noise and yielding a large amount of data.
